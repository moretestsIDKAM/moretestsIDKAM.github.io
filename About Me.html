 <center><h2>Here is some information about me.</h2>
<p>I want to be an animator in the near future. I've</p>
<p>had an intrest in the feild of animation ever since</p>
<p>I was ten after watching a segment on how animation for</p>
<p>the Rugrats in Paris movie was made. I'm currently an </p>
<p>Animation and Illustration major studying at San Jose </p>
<p>State University.</p>

<center><h2>Artsit Statement</h2>
<p>As an artist I like to play with color especially gradients</p>
<p>because the smooth transition between colors is such an </p>
<p>apealing sight to me. I like to combine texture and </p>
<p>stylization into my works aswell. When I have time to I </p>
<p>like to draw characters, and draft out stories to use these</p>
<p>characters in. Lately I've been drawing alot of fan art in my</p>
<p>free time since it's just nice to play with existing</p>
<p>characters from time to time.</p>
