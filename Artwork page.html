 <p>Bun Bun Is Ill Honey</p> 
<p>"Bun Bun Is Ill Honey" is a 3D Colladge work I</p>
<p>made with Autodesk Meshmixer, it's bunny model</p>
<p>and Poly by Google​’s models.The art work is</p>
<p>commentary on the dangers of American work</p>
<p>cultue.The story convaed is that the bunny</p>
<p>is over working themselves at the expense</p>
<p>of thier health.They havn't taken thier</p>
<p>medication because thier boss sees it as a</p>
<p>liablity. I chose green to represent sickness</p>
<p>and greed. It can be viewed from many angles in</p>
<p>Sketchfab.</p>

 <p>Gemstone Light Show Room</p> 
<p>"Gemstone Light Show Room" is a work made using</p>
<p>p5.js. At first I had only floating gems but</p>
<p>I wanted to disply them nicely. So I recreated</p>
<p>a light room that resembled a James Turrell's</p>
<p>work.I combined parts from codes in p5.js's</p>
<p>refrence page and modified them until I was</p>
<p>satisfied with the result. I even made the gem</p>
<p>textures myself using the drawing program Artrage.</p>
<p>One can play with the lighting on p5.js's web</p>
<p>editor.Click this image to open the link.</p>

 <p>Diamond Experiment</p> 
<p>"Diamond Experiment" is a work made using ArtRage.</p>
<p>I was experimenting with the flat Diamond texture I</p>
<p>made some time ago to create a Diamond. I like </p>
<p>how it came out.</p>

 <p>Marchhare</p> 
<p>"Marchhare" is a work made using ArtRage.</p>
<p>I wanted to make the hare for a sequel to my</p>
<p>narrative website "Alice Urban Explorer" where</p>
<p>this gem head would be the mascot of the chatbot</p>
<p>"March Hare" where the continuation of the</p>
<p>previous instalment begins. I felt proud of</p>
<p>I am proud of how belivable the gem texture is.</p>

<p>"Chicken Comic" is a work made using bristol paper</p>
<p>and tradtional inks. I made this for my ANI 112A</p>

 <p>Charlotte</p> 
<p>"Charlotte" is a work made using bristol paper</p>
<p>and tradtional inks. I made this for my ANI 112A</p>
<p>class in which I was tasked to design a character</p>
<p>for an adaptation of an urban legend. My story was</p>
<p>"Spider Bite" and designed a main character.</p>
<p>I also spiced things up by having the story take</p>
<p>place in the 1980s(hence the fashion) while useing</p>
<p>an artsyle from the 1920s to 1930s.</p>

<p>was tasked with making a comic adaptaion of my</p>
<p>chosen urban legend using the style and character</p>
<p>I designed.This first page introduces Charlotte</p>
<p>and her misbehaviors. I wanted to give the comic a</p>
<p>"animated short from the 20s that would unsettle</p>
<p>people online due to the horrific turn at the end."</p>
<p>feel, so I used watered down ink to mimic water</p>
<p>color and cartoon hummor via a semi annoyed</p>
<p>narrator.</p>
